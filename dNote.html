                    <h2> Directors' Notes </h2>
                    
                    <p> 
                    Katie and I have different experiences with <span style="font-style: italic">Coraline</span>. For Katie, it's a novel she loves. For me, it was a movie
                    I went to see in theaters where I had to leave and hide in the bathroom half way through because I was terrified.
                    Now that I'm 21 (almost 22!) and a huge horror fan, I have such a love for this show. It is creepy and funny and fantastical and I love it for the 
                    bizarre combination of the three.
                    When Katie brought up the idea of doing this show, I was hesitant, but then we immediately came up with so many creative and fun ideas to bring such a wild story to life on stage.
                    As techies, bringing an animated fantasy to reality is a challenge we were excited to face. And thankfully, we also have Lily who was crazy enough to say yes to this.
                    Thank you to Katie for trusting me with your baby. I am honored to work by your side and have you as my best friend. 
                    Thank you to our amazing cast for being strange and weird without hesitation. Every one of you is so amazing and talented and I'll 
                    never shut up about it. So many of the people involved in this show either had never done theater before or hadn't in a long time and you would never know (but thank you, each of 
                    you, for taking the risk).
                    As a senior, this might be my last experience with theater and I could not be happier to end on this show.  
                    Now please let your imagination take hold, and enjoy <span style="font-style: italic">Coraline</span> :) - Gil <3

                    <p>It’s true— <span style="font-style: italic">Coraline</span> is a children’s book. But there’s something about the story that hasn't left me since I read and saw it for the first time years ago, and I think there’s 
                       a lot that it can remind us of: being grateful for the mundane things; facing your fears to stand up for the people you love; staying curious and hopeful and strong in the face
                       of the darkest adversity. I still have a lot to learn from our daring heroine, but I hope that she can inspire you all with even a bit of the same lust for life that she inspires in me.
                       There are so many people that made this show possible. I’m forever grateful to our uber-talented cast for making <span style="font-style: italic">Coraline</span> our own. I never could’ve imagined when I was creating the script that it could 
                       be so fun and so suspenseful and so full of life. Thank you to Mari for stepping up as a first-time stage manager and for keeping me sane throughout the process, and to Lily for helping create a world 
                       for us to play in. And of course thank you to my partner in crime, Gil, for saying yes to my crazy idea, matching my energy, and exceeding it in every way. I truly and in every sense could not have put 
                       on this show without you. And of course, thanks to all of you for coming to support everyone’s hard work—after all, what would a show be without people to share it with? We’ve been waiting for you!
