                    <h2> Directors' Note </h2>
                    
                    <p> 
                    Katie and I have different experiences with <span style="font-style: italic">Coraline</span>. For Katie, it's a novel she loves. For me, it was a movie
                    I went to see in theaters where I had to leave and hide in the bathroom half way through because I was terrified.
                    Now that I'm 21 (almost 22!) and a huge horror fan, I have such a love for this show. It is creepy and funny and fantastical and I love it for the 
                    bizarre combination of the three.
                    When Katie brought up the idea of doing this show, I was hesitant, but then we immediately came up with so many creative and fun ideas to bring such a wild story to life on stage.
                    As techies, bringing an animated fantasy to reality is a challenge we were excited to face. And thankfully, we also have Lily who was crazy enough to say yes to this.
                    Thank you to Katie for trusting me with your baby. I am honored to work by your side and have you as my best friend. 
                    Thank you to our amazing cast for being strange and weird without hesitation. Every one of you is so amazing and talented and I'll 
                    never shut up about it. So many of the people involved in this show either had never done theater before or hadn't in a long time and you would never know (but thank you, each of 
                    you, for taking the risk).
                    As a senior, this might be my last experience with theater and I could not be happier to end on this show.  
                    Now please let your imagination take hold, and enjoy <span style="font-style: italic">Coraline</span> :) - Gil <3
